# SMS Spam Detection using BERT
## Overview
MS spam detection app, powered by Hugging Face's BERT model and deployed on Streamlit, offers users a simple yet powerful solution to identify spam messages in their SMS inbox. Through an intuitive user interface, users can input text messages for analysis. The app preprocesses the text, applies the BERT model trained on a SMS spam collection dataset, and classifies the message as spam or non-spam with high accuracy. Leveraging the deep understanding of natural language provided by BERT, the app ensures reliable detection of spam messages, helping users protect themselves from unwanted communication.
